**Description**: The student grade table is an information table listing student names, courses and grades. <br>

##Features
* Total grade point average of all students.
* Alphabetical organization option for student name and student course.
* Add and delete students.
* Auto completion on form for courses.

##Project Notes
  * This is the first project I did using AJAX calls. Not only was it useful in learning 
    how to retrieve information, but also in how to pull specific information with JSON.
